# Project Mongo API

The projects purpose was to make a mongoDB database connection with a repository of books and create the endpoints so that the information can be accessed.

## The problem

I first looked at which information I wanted out of it. As a user, if I wanted to do a search in a for example library catalogue or an online bookstore, what would be the endpoints I would like to have. Since this was a project during the Technigo bootcamp we had restrictions on what to do and which tools to work with. We also had a .json file ready for this project which we then seeded into the Atlas MongoDB. The deployment happened on Render.

If I had more time I would have done the different stretch goals.
